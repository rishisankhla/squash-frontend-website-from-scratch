        <h3>Name - Rishi Sankhla<br>Candidate No. LX1560</h3>
        <h3>REPORT</h3>
        
        <p>
            The structure I chose to implement on my website is hierarchical model, we can see that in most of the pages, specially in HTML pages.<br>
            The main story which my website tells is about squash game, in some country squash is an under-rated sports, but if we look at the game then we can see that it's quite an overall game.<br>
            So my website is basically a squash blog, which provide information related to squash clubs, squash news, squash general knowledge etc, so it acts like a daily squash magazine for those people who love squash game and it also provide general awareness among non-sports person.
        </p>

        Three things who served as an inspiration for me to create this website are:
        <ul>
            <li>lack of general knowledge about squash sports</li>
            <li>Mohamed El Shorbagy - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_El_Shorbagy</li>
            <li>Biggest squash organisation PSA - https://psaworldtour.com/</li>
        </ul> 
        
        <p>these are the 3 ways in which my site is accessible:
        <ul>
            <li>Adding alternate text in all the images, so that screen reader can read them.</li>
            <li>Specifying my all HTML pages in a proper hierarchical structure, so that meaning of each tag becomes clear while reading.</li>
            <li>choosing proper color scheme so that conveys the message.</li>
        </ul> 
        
        Three ways in which we can consider the usability of the website:
        <ul>
            <li>Adding progress bar in info page, so that user can see how much page he/she had scrolled down.</li>
            <li>Adding menu button(toggle switch) for mobile version of the site, so that user can easily switch between page on cell phone.</li>
            <li>Adding drop down box to change font size in info page, so that elderly users can read all the articles easily.</li>
        </ul> 

        Three things which I learn while building tthis website is:
        <ul>
            <li>I learnt to implement HTML template through javascript library that is handlebar.js, i build a small template for my site's footer.</li>
            <li>I learnt to build image slide-show using javascript with the help of w3schools.com, which I implemented by manipulating HTML tag through DOM concept.</li>
            <li>last but not least I learnt to build animations using CSS, like I have built one rotating image animation in news page using transform attribute.</li>
        </ul> 
        
        <div>
            Evaluation 1:<br>
            I think there were few aspects like font-size button, rotating magazine, slide-show(using javascript) which were sucessfull.<br> Because they were not hard to built and they convey the message to user easily, about the squash sports.<br>
            And not to forget to mention that implementation of footer using javascript library was also a sucessfull aspect of website because handlebar.js made it easy to implement complex footer over again and again.<br><br> 

            Evaluation 2:<br>
            There are definitely few things which we can improve in future like implementation of media query, grid layout of footer etc.<br>
            If in future I get chance to improve these things then i would start with footer, becasue i have implemented quite a big footer with lots of CSS attribute.<br>This time I would select the appropriate font style for better responsiveness of footer(eg for mobile version - choosing propper font alignment).<br>
            And we can also add few more media query in between tablet and mobile version, so that user can get best experiance out of it. We can also tackle this issue by using bootstrap CSS library.<br><br>
